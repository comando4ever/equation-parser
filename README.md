# equation-parser
This is my graduation project, a mathematical equations parser, it parses mathematical equations into coefficient matrix.
It originally contained a Windows and Windows Phone application but was removed to make it portable, and the solver needs to be reimplemented.

**GraduationProject.Console** is just a demo of the parser's functionality.
